# This is a cognitive neuroscience oriented master's thesis. We are investigating the role of experience in ketamine-assisted therapy in treatment-resistant depression patients at Ã˜stfold hospital. We are looking at the role of ego dissolution, stress levels, brain activity measured through EEG and expectations. These predictors will be linked to the depression levels patients experience 3 to 6 months later.
